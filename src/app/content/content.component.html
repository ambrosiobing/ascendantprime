                Ascendant Prime is an online game universe focused on the Creation, Modification and Trade of digital collectibles. In this case, the collectibles in question are humanoid Avatars created from scratch using Genes and other raw materials. The Ascendant Prime Universe is based in a parallel timeline of earth; one where humans, through a global-scale depopulation agenda gone awry, have collectively lost their ability to reproduce, which inevitably leads to a solution for some: the choice to continue life within a synthetic body, leaving nature’s original gifts behind. It is the creation of this synthetic body that is the epicenter of Ascendant Prime’s gameplay. In essence, it allows you to play your own version of God; creating synthetic life exactly as you envision it from the comfort of your own living-room or workspace. Ascendant Prime’s infrastructure is based on the latest blockchain technology, and it is on this platform where you possess the power to create a totally Unique and genuine one-of-a-kind synthetic physical body known as a Creation; It lives, it breathes, it grows according to your preferences. Once this Creation is brought to life, it exists permanently; it cannot be destroyed unless that is your wish and it cannot be duplicated.
Through your choices and Experiments, you alone control and manipulate your Avatars growth process. This is accomplished in part by using Genes and a process known as Splicing. Quite simply; You, the Creator, are able to customize every physical and abstract aspect of your Creation through the aforementioned process making this new artificial body of yours truly your own. Additionally, you may wish to breed your Creation with another creating an entirely new Offspring that shares the genetic qualities and traits of its progenitors; much like an organic counterpart.
                <br><br>
                The Exhibition; an online emporium dedicated to Ascendant Prime’s community, is always readily available should you wish to display your Creations and communicate freely with others. It is here that you can also trade your Avatars, Genes and Wearables, or purchase new ones if so inspired.
                <br><br>
                <font color="#d3672f">Ascendant Prime is the freedom to create synthetic life</font>;  unlimited, unrestricted, immutable and permanent. Create an exact synthetic replica of yourself, or perhaps be a pioneer in this new artificial race and create something imaginable only by few; something truly unprecedented. In Ascendant Prime, the means to do either are available and the choice is always unequivocally yours.
